# Alfred extension: Anycomplete

Idea is borrowed from [anycomplete](https://github.com/nathancahill/anycomplete), which
was discovered on [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13065670).

## Usage

In alfred type `g any text`. Select the text and it will be automatically pasted
in the focused application. 

Another option is to select some text in the application and invoke `⌃⌥⌘G`, that
will trigger Alfred workflow with `g [selected text]`.
